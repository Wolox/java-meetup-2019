### Branches
- **master:** It has some basic configurations and examples to use Camel in different ways
- **examples-ppt:** Here you'll see all the examples that were shown on the Java Meetup presentation
- **demo-jerigonza:** This is the code from the project used for the Java Meetup, which takes a text from the user and using a service it detects some grammatical errors. Then, depending on the convert param, you could convert the text to jerigonza
- **amd-client:** As we know that a basic usage of a REST API is to add, modify and delete resources, we create this basic project which you could use to start your own AMD :)
